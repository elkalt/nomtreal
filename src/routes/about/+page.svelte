      This site is a Montreal restaurant review blog that aims to fill a gap in the Montreal food review scene by providing easy to navigate
      reviews that are not only categorized by cuisine, but also by price range and location. The goal is to provide a resource for people
      (especially students) to find restaurants that fit their budget and location, while also providing a variety of cuisines to choose from.
